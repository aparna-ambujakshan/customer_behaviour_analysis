Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis – Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project walks through a full end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to analyze customer shopping behavior, uncover patterns in spending and product preferences, and present insights through a polished dashboard and final report.
It covers everything from data loading and cleaning to database integration, SQL analysis, visualization, and presentation.

Dataset

Rows: 3,900

Columns: 18

Data Includes:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location, subscription status)

Purchase details (item, category, amount, season, size, color)

Behavioral data (discounts, frequency, review ratings, shipping type)

The dataset was cleaned, standardized, and enriched through feature engineering in Python.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (dashboard creation)

Gamma.app (presentation)

Excel (optional reviews and summaries)

Project Steps
1. Data Loading in Python

Imported the raw dataset using Pandas

Checked structure, data types, and summary statistics

Assessed missing values and data quality

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis

Outlier checks

Correlation patterns

Early insights into products, customers, and revenue trends

3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Imputed missing values
